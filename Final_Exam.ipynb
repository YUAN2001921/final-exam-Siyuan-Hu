The pseudocode for my CLI Task Manager using only techniques taught in Weeks 1 to 10, such as lists for data storage, functions with parameters, loops for iteration, and basic error checking with try/except. The structured menu system requested that repeated until the user chose to quit, validated the menu choice so only numbers 1 to 4 were accepted, prevented adding empty tasks by checking the input string, and displayed task numbers starting from 1 for clarity. The goal was to apply the decision-making and loop patterns from Weeks 3 and 4, combined with the function and error-handling concepts from Week 6, to make the program more user-friendly and robust.\n",

The second refinement applied file I/O operations from Week 9, allowing data to persist between sessions and demonstrating the practical use of open(), read(), and write() within defensive code blocks. I followed the structured pseudocode-planning method from Week 7, which guided each stage of refinement and ensured logical consistency.\n",
