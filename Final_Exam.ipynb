The pseudocode for my CLI Task Manager using only techniques taught in Weeks 1 to 10, such as lists for data storage, functions with parameters, loops for iteration, and basic error checking with try/except. The structured menu system requested that repeated until the user chose to quit, validated the menu choice so only numbers 1 to 4 were accepted, prevented adding empty tasks by checking the input string, and displayed task numbers starting from 1 for clarity. The goal was to apply the decision-making and loop patterns from Weeks 3 and 4, combined with the function and error-handling concepts from Week 6, to make the program more user-friendly and robust.\n",

The second refinement applied file I/O operations from Week 9, allowing data to persist between sessions and demonstrating the practical use of open(), read(), and write() within defensive code blocks. I followed the structured pseudocode-planning method from Week 7, which guided each stage of refinement and ensured logical consistency.\n",

        "This refined version strengthens reliability by introducing simple input validation and a single, generic try/except that aligns with the Week 8 skill level. The input check prevents invalid or empty city names before making an API call, thereby avoiding malformed URLs. The generic try and except encapsulates both the network request and JSON parsing, ensuring the program does not crash when the service is unreachable or the data is malformed. Instead of advanced exception typing or logging, short print statements provide clear, user friendly feedback. The function consistently returns either a dictionary success or None (failure) to maintain predictable behavior, and the embedded doctest examples illustrate expected input and output patterns following Week 9’s testing format.\n",

Finally, my testing approach follows Week 9 (Testing and Doctest Examples lecture), which demonstrates embedding small doctests inside docstrings to confirm correct output behavior for both valid and invalid cases."

I tried to concentrate on the structure, and I used AI as a check to syntax, or to clarify the behaviour of the Python language that I did not understand. I believe that this process enabled me to remain accountable to my logic without spending much time on technical specifics and maintain the balance between human planning and AI-assisted enhancement.\n",

These steps improved my confidence in building stable, crash-resistant code and reminded me of the value of small but consistent preventive checks.\n",

Using the iterative refinement process, I will improve this by creating one reusable print function and modularising my logic. This technique, inspired by the later weeks, will make my final project cleaner, easier to maintain, and more professional.\n"
