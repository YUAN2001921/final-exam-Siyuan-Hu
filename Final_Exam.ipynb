The pseudocode for my CLI Task Manager using only techniques taught in Weeks 1 to 10, such as lists for data storage, functions with parameters, loops for iteration, and basic error checking with try/except. The structured menu system requested that repeated until the user chose to quit, validated the menu choice so only numbers 1 to 4 were accepted, prevented adding empty tasks by checking the input string, and displayed task numbers starting from 1 for clarity. The goal was to apply the decision-making and loop patterns from Weeks 3 and 4, combined with the function and error-handling concepts from Week 6, to make the program more user-friendly and robust.\n",

By integrating these topics, I ensured the program could repeatedly prompt users and reject invalid inputs. I also applied functions and parameters from Week 4 and error handling with try and except from Week 6, which improved modularity and prevented runtime crashes. The second refinement applied file I/O operations from Week 9, allowing data to persist between sessions and demonstrating the practical use of open(), read(), and write() within defensive code blocks. I followed the structured pseudocode-planning method from Week 7, which guided each stage of refinement and ensured logical consistency.\n",

        "This refined version strengthens reliability by introducing simple input validation and a single, generic try/except that aligns with the Week 8 skill level. The input check prevents invalid or empty city names before making an API call, thereby avoiding malformed URLs. The generic try and except encapsulates both the network request and JSON parsing, ensuring the program does not crash when the service is unreachable or the data is malformed. Instead of advanced exception typing or logging, short print statements provide clear, user friendly feedback. The function consistently returns either a dictionary success or None (failure) to maintain predictable behavior, and the embedded doctest examples illustrate expected input and output patterns following Week 9’s testing format.\n",

Finally, my testing approach follows Week 9 (Testing and Doctest Examples lecture), which demonstrates embedding small doctests inside docstrings to confirm correct output behavior for both valid and invalid cases."
