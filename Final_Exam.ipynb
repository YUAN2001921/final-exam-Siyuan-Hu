The first refinement applied Input Validation and Defensive Programming from Week 6, as I implemented try and except blocks to handle invalid menu inputs and blank task entries. The second refinement used Menu Design and Program Flow Control from Week 3, helping me build a clearer text-based interface with a summary option for better user experience. My use of Iteration and Loop Structures from Week 5 ensured that the program continuously processed user actions until exit, preventing abrupt termination. Finally, I followed Integration and Application Techniques from Week 10, combining all earlier concepts, such as functions, validation, iteration, and user interaction which into one cohesive pseudocode design. Altogether, these refinements demonstrate a structured progression from planning to implementation using the complete learning sequence developed across the ten weeks."
