Brief Summary


This is where I keep my final exam submission to the unit of ISYS5000. It shows how I used the essential principles of Python programming and debugging skills in Weeks 1 to 10 with in view of the technical limitation and good coding principles provided by the course.

The tasks involved the following activities: Input and Output handling (Week 2-3) - interaction with user by means of print and input.

Variables, List, and Dictionaries (Week 4-6)- data storage and management within memory.

Conditional Statements and Loops (Week 4–5) – using if/else and while for control flow.

Functions - with Parameters and Return Values (Week 6-7) - to have a modular code structure.

Basic Error Handling with try/except (Week 8) – ensuring simple fault tolerance. 

Testing and Debugging (Week 9-10) - the detection, analysis, and correction of bugs in the code.

Both sections involve solving problems one step at a time and refining to obsessive-compulsive levels:

Section 1: Bluetooth codification of a pseudocode relating to a CLI Task Manager under use of loops and validation.

Section 2: Debugging and correcting errors with structured logic and print-based validation.

Section 3: Rewriting a Weather Data Fetcher function using safe input validation and single try/except handling.

Section 4: Development of a comprehensive interactive task manager by integrating all the techniques learned.

Conversation Log: An overview of my experience of using AI during my debugging sessions and how I entered an essential error correction phase by major steps.


Important Notes & Constraints:

Every solution relies on methods that are discussed in Weeks 1-10.

None of the outside modules (with the exception of the weather API requests).

None of the complex libraries, file persistence and sophisticated syntax.

Handling of errors was also kept simple and consistent printed messages were used.

All programs are aimed at logic clarity, user readability and accuracy.


Reflection

This unit has been an important experience to me. I was a beginner who almost had no experience in code, however, it was possible to learn how to think and learn how code structures work over time. This course gave me the confidence to read, write and enhance Python programs. Studying as an AI learning assistant (ChatGPT) made me more effective and comprehended issues much quicker, so my work was always within the scope of course regulations. I also wish to sincerely thank my lecturer whose patient and timely advice all through the semester made me advance steadily and to learn the programming experience which I enjoyed.
