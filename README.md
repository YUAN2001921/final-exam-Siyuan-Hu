Brief Summary


This repository contains my final exam submission for the ISYS5000 unit. It demonstrates how I applied key Python programming concepts and debugging techniques from Weeks 1 to 10, following the course’s technical constraints and good coding practices.


The tasks required using:
Input and Output handling (Week 2–3) – using print() and input() for user interaction. 

Variables, Lists, and Dictionaries (Week 4–6) – storing and managing data in memory.

Conditional Statements and Loops (Week 4–5) – using if/else and while for control flow.

Functions with Parameters and Return Values (Week 6–7) – for modular code structure.

Basic Error Handling with try/except (Week 8) – ensuring simple fault tolerance. 

Testing and Debugging (Week 9–10) – identifying, analyzing, and fixing code errors.

Each section focuses on step-by-step problem solving and iterative refinement:

Section 1: Prompt refinement for a CLI Task Manager pseudocode using loops and validation.

Section 2: Debugging and correcting errors with structured logic and print-based validation.

Section 3: Rewriting a Weather Data Fetcher function using safe input validation and single try/except handling.

Section 4: Creating a complete interactive task manager that combines all learned techniques.

Conversation Log: Summarizes my AI-assisted debugging sessions and how I progressively fixed logic errors.



Important Notes & Constraints:

All solutions only use techniques covered in Weeks 1–10.

No external modules (except requests for the weather API).

No complex libraries, file persistence, or advanced syntax.

Error handling kept simple, with clear and consistent printed messages.

Every program focuses on logic clarity, user readability, and correctness.



Reflection

Learning this unit has been a meaningful journey for me. I started as a beginner with almost no coding experience, but gradually learned how to think logically and understand how code structures work. Through this course, I built confidence in reading, writing, and improving Python programs. Using AI as a learning assistant helped me study more efficiently and understand problems faster, while always keeping my work aligned with course rules. I also sincerely thank my lecturer for the patient and timely guidance throughout the semester, your feedback and explanations made me progress steadily and enjoy learning programming.
