SECTION 1 - PROMPT 1

My prompt:
“The pseudocode for Section 1.1 is as follows:
Design a CLI Task Manager that lets the user add, list, and remove tasks.
Please help me write Section 1.2, which requires two prompt refinements.”

AI RESPONSE:
AI proposed two refinements for the original pseudocode:

Added explicit planning for validation and structured menu control based on Week 4–6 course logic.

Improved pseudocode layout with proper indentation, parameterized functions, and menu iteration loop.
AI also explained that the refinement demonstrates iterative improvement similar to the Week 9 “refinement cycle” approach.

COURSE CONSTRAINT CHECK:
AI’s initial draft suggested more advanced syntax; I simplified it to use only lists, loops, and simple functions, consistent with Week 6 functional programming limits.

SECTION 1 - PROMPT 2

My prompt:
“Please refine my Section 1.2 version again. Use only content taught from Week 1–10.”

AI RESPONSE:
AI refined the prompt text for greater specificity. It added requirements to validate user input, show clearer structure for function interactions, and ensure menu persistence until the user chooses Quit. It applied Week 5–6 iterative structure and Week 8-style validation consistency.

COURSE CONSTRAINT CHECK:
Removed AI’s suggestions about importing modules or using external file storage; final pseudocode remained fully in-memory, aligned with Week 4–6 tools.
